# MASH, The Game
**Team Members: Nikhil Anand, Gia Douglass, & Spencer Griffin**

1. The goal of our project is to make the game MASH. This game has four categories predicting someone’s future, for example what state they will live in, what car they will have, etc.. Under each category are four possible scenarios, for example a fiat, porsche, BMW, and Honda for the car category. These values will either be randomly generated by the creators (us), or be inputted by the person playing the game (the user).

After this same process is done for the other categories, the screen should output a graphic spiral that will be the basis on how many predictions should be skipped. Once a prediction is landed on, it is crossed off until only one prediction remains for a category. These outcomes become the players “final future.”

Our lower bound goal is to predict someone’s future with a premade list of outcomes from a randomly generated number that will be shown as a spiral. The upper bound end goal is to predict someone’s future using the user’s input and then telling the game when to stop drawing the spiral, picking their number themselves.

2. Our learning goals for this project is to further understand the logic of programming in C, and using the graphics API OpenGL. We hope to achieve all this through the creation of our game, as it involves using various features and APIs of C.

3. We've begun to construct the lists that will be used for our categories (i.e future car, income, etc.). We're making good progress with this functionality and should be on our way to having the users be able to input the values on their own (the upper bound of the project). The next step that we can begin to code is the functionality of removing the nth value of a list based on the user input.
We are still researching the best tools to create our spiral graphic at the center of the game. We were first planning on using OpenGL to do this, but found that is over engineering the situation and looking for better 2d graphics to use for this program. We will send you an email with the resource to share with future classes when we decide on the best tool.

4. At the mid-way point of our project we are making good progress, and look to be on track to completing our project. With a team of three we are able to work in parallel, dividing the work into three task: creating categories and inputs (Gia), removing inputs based users number inputs (Spencer), and creating a spiral graphic for the game (Nikhil). For Gia's task, it will be done when are category lists are created and properly appear in the game. For Spencer, when the nth items in our lists are able to be removed from the count of the game it will be done. For Nikhil, the graphics will be considered done when, at minimum, the users inputted number corresponds to the number of vertical lines of the spiral, or at maximum, continue to spiral until the user terminates the graphic from running.
