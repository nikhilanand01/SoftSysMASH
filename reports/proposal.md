# MASH, The Game
**Team Members: Nikhil Anand, Gia Douglass, & Spencer Griffin**

1. The goal of our project is to make the game MASH. This game has four categories predicting someone’s future, for example what state they will live in, what car they will have, etc.. Under each category are four possible scenarios, for example a fiat, porsche, BMW, and Honda for the car category. These values will either be randomly generated by the creators (us), or be inputted by the person playing the game (the user).
After this same process is done for the other categories, the screen should output a graphic spiral that will be the basis on how many predictions should be skipped. Once a prediction is landed on, it is crossed off until only one prediction remains for a category. These outcomes become the players “final future.”
Our lower bound goal is to predict someone’s future with a premade list of outcomes from a randomly generated number that will be shown as a spiral. The upper bound end goal is to predict someone’s future using the user’s input and then telling the game when to stop drawing the spiral, picking their number themselves.

2. Our learning goals for this project is to further understand the logic of programming in C, and using the graphics API OpenGL. We hope to achieve all this through the creation of our game, as it involves using various features and APIs of C.

3. To get started, we need to learn OpenGL. We will be using [learnopengl.com](learnopengl.com) as well as other online video tutorials to learn. To further our understanding in C we continue to practice more aspects of the language to get more comfortable with it before moving on to more complex features.

4. The three concrete tasks to do for this project and who will be doing them are below.

- The first is to learn how to draw a spiral with the API OpenGL. Nikhil will be in charge of this task and creating the spiral. If we reach our MVP, the project should take the random number and create a spiral based off of that. If we get to our stretch goals we’ll consider this part done when the spiral is drawn and terminated by a user prop.
- The second task is to create all categories as list arrays and create lists inside each one of the predictions. This task will be handled by Gia. This task will be considered finished when we find at least 10 items in each category list for the program to choose from (it will pick 4 from this number). If we go to our stretch goals the user will be inputting this information.
- Finally we need to create the logic of crossing off every nth element off the list until only one element remains in each category. This task will be handled by Spencer. It will be considered finished when the program is able to remove the items from the game (i.e. cross it out).
