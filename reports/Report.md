1. The goal of our project is to make the game MASH. This game has four categories predicting someone’s future, for example what state they will live in, what car they will have, etc.. Under each category are four possible scenarios, for example a fiat, porsche, BMW, and Honda for the car category. These values will either be randomly generated by the creators (us), or be inputted by the person playing the game (the user).

    After this same process is done for the other categories, the screen should output a graphic spiral that will be the basis on how many predictions should be skipped. Once a prediction is landed on, it is crossed off until only one prediction remains for a category. These outcomes become the players “final future.”

    Our lower bound goal is to predict someone’s future with a premade list of outcomes from a randomly generated number that will be shown as a spiral. The upper bound end goal is to predict someone’s future using the user’s input and then telling the game when to stop drawing the spiral, picking their number themselves.

2. Our learning goals for this project is to further understand the logic of programming in C, and using the graphics API OpenGL. We hope to achieve all this through the creation of our game, as it involves using various features and APIs of C.

5. An issue we ran into early on in our code design was our inability to draw the spiral. The spiral is a key component of the game and we identified this as a potential obstacle in our project updates. Nikhil with the help of the rest of team did extensive research on possibe libraries or APIs that might offer graphics that would fit our spiral description. Our initial plan was to try OpenGL and test it out. However, this did not work out. Our team members had experience using Turtle graphics in other languages and believed we could implement this using C code. Similarly, this idea did not pan out. We consulted with Ninja's and eventually concluded that a spiral was too complex to be created with Turtle using C.  

    We could implement a random number generator and use that value to determine the rate of input removals. We realized this would not be as satisfying and enjoyable for the end user. Furthermore, we didn't want to sell ourselves out and default to a simple basic randomization. After much discussion and thought, Nikhil came up with an idea to create a randomly generated tree. The number of rows in this tree graphic would equal the value used to cross off the user inputs for the game. Thus, our team had to work around this issue and we found a solution that was able to incorporate both graphics and functionality into one.

7. Reflecting on the outcome of our project, our team did an excellent job of designing the game and adapting to the challenges that were thrown at us along the way. We ended up somewhere in the middle of our learning goal bounds. While we were not able to achieve the spiral graphic, we were able to take user input from each category and remove the inputs accordingly to come up with a final "prediction." 

    Our team is proud of our accomplishnments because the road to completing our code was not easy. There were times where our code would only choose the first input for each category. There were also instances where we desperately tried to get our graphics to work to no avail. When we were presented with these challenges, we perservered and tweaked the code many times to make it work. When the tweaks did not fix the problem, we took proactive steps to complete extensive research and seek outside help. The road to our finished code was not straight and was filled with bumbs. However, in the end, our team is better off because of it and will take our learning lessons with us as we continue our journey towards being better coders.
