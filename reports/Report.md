# MASH, The Game
**Team Members: Nikhil Anand, Gia Douglass, & Spencer Griffin**

1. The goal of our project is to make the game MASH. This game has four categories predicting someone’s future, for example what state they will live in, what car they will have, etc.. Under each category are four possible scenarios, for example a fiat, porsche, BMW, and Honda for the car category. These values will either be randomly generated by the creators (us), or be inputted by the person playing the game (the user).

    After this same process is done for the other categories, the screen should output a graphic shape (in the beginning we were thinking of a spiral shape) that will be the basis on how many predictions should be skipped. Once a prediction is landed on, it is crossed off until only one prediction remains for a category. These outcomes become the players “final future.”

    Our lower bound goal is to predict someone’s future with a premade list of outcomes and user inputted responses. From there a randomly generated number will then be shown as a shape and that same number will be used as the interval to create the “future” results. The upper bound end goal is to predict someone’s future using the user’s input and then telling the game when to stop creating the shape, creating their interval number, and making the user pick their MASH future with all their information.

2. Our learning goals for this project is to further understand the logic of programming in C, and seeing how to best create graphics in C - potentially using the graphics APIs. We hope to achieve all this through the creation of our game, as it involves using various features of C.

3. For this project a useful resource we found was [Game Programming in C - For Beginners](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/447332/Game-Programming-in-C-For-Beginners) as it helped us think of the logic of how to structure our game, and some things to include to make the game better, like "End of game messages." We looked at many potential resources for creating the graphic for the game, but none of them worked well for us (more on that later).

4. For this project we were able to create a fully functioning game! The functionality is closer to our lower end, but still does what we wanted the game to do. The game will have the same first topic MASH: Mansion, Apartment, Shack, and House that the user doesn't have to input as it is standard in all games. The user will then be prompted to put responses in 3 randomly generated topics (i.e. Car, Number of Friends, Amount of future money, etc.). Once the responses are entered the game will use a random number between 1-20 to be used as the interval to cross out options until only one response per category is left. While this is happening our program will output a triangle shape (instead of a spiral) with the rows of the triangle being the randomly generated interval number used for getting the responses. The shape was created using nested loops instead of using an API or C library. You can see the results of our game in the image below. There were 4 responses entered for each category and the game generated the results and shape with the interval of 13. ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikhilanand01/SoftSysMASH/master/reports/Screen%20Shot%202020-04-03%20at%201.14.48%20PM.png "Game Results")

5. An issue we ran into early on in our project design was figuring out how to create the shape for the result of the game. We wanted to create a spiral, similar to how the game is played on paper, but that ended up being quite unattainable. We looked at various C libraries and APIs that might offer graphics that would fit our spiral description, but none of them worked with what we needed as they were either too complex (i.e. 3d graphics for a simple 2d shape) or the libraries were deprected to the point where they do not work with newer systems that we were using to create this game. An example of that is the library "graphics.h" which was used in many examples of creating shapes, but it turns out the library only works on certain windows computers/systems from the late 90s early 2000s. Other libraries we looked at were OpenGL, Cairo, and Turtle. Once these options failed we decided to use our own code to create a shape. We used a series of nested loops to create a triangle shape that would generate in place of the spiral. With the new triangle the amount of rows would be the lines used in the interval to choose the options. So for example if the interval was 5, the triangle would be 5 rows of top to bottom (refer to the results image for more clarification). We found this to be an elegant solution that adds to the game, instead of distracting from the main goal, creating a "future" for the user.   

6. One of the most important functions in our program is poetically called *mash*. It has all the logic of traversing through each topic and crossing off the answer in a category whenever an interval lands on it. This is the function used to get the results that would be outputted for the user. It crosses off based on the random number used for the triangle function below.

    Our shape function *interval* created a triangle for the game according to the number of rows randomly generated. This function made the game more interesting for the user as it added graphics to MASH. A snippet of the code is below showing how the triangle is made based on the random number coming from `int randomnumber= rand() % 20;`. You can refer to the full function in the *main.c* file.
    ```Triangle Function
    for (count1=1;count1<limit*2;count1+=2){
      for (count2=0;count2<count3;count2++)
          printf(" ");
      for (count2=0;count2<count1;count2++){
          printf("*");
      }
      printf("\n");
      count3--;
    ```

7. Reflecting on the outcome of our project, our team did an excellent job of designing the game and adapting to the challenges that were thrown at us along the way. We ended up somewhere in the middle of our learning goal bounds. While we were not able to achieve the spiral graphic, we were able to create a triangle graphic that accomplishes the same thing we wanted the spiral to do. We were also able to take user input from each category and remove the inputs accordingly to come up with a final " future prediction." With our learning goals, we managed to learn much more about the logic, and syntax about C, and even though we didn't end up using the graphic libraries or APIs we still did learn a lot about them (and how they don't work for a project like this).

    Our team is proud of our accomplishments because the road to completing our code was not easy. There were times where our code would only choose the first input for each category. There were also instances where we desperately tried to get our graphics to work to no avail. When we were presented with these challenges, we tweaked the code to make it work. When the tweaks did not fix the problem, we took proactive steps to complete extensive research and seek outside help. The road to our finished code was not straight and was filled with bumps. However, in the end, our team is better off because of it and will take our learning lessons with us as we continue our journey towards being better coders.
